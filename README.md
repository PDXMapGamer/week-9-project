    Due to being unable to finish the project on time due to feeling unwell I have been granted an extention, only to complete the required tasks.

    Requirements
    🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk. #DONE
    🎯 Create and display an error page if the user visits a user profile that doesn’t exist. #DONE
    🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive or something similar (e.g. use of another library to enhance UX). (conformation of deleting posts, however deleting post is not impemented but it isn't one of the requirements.)#DONE
    🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]). #DONE
    🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page. #DONE

Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Allow users to view other profiles directly from posts they see on the global timeline. #DONE (Only because this is the most convenient way to implement a way to navagate to the user's profile without forcing users to type in the URL, to do one of the required tasks.)
    🏹 Let users follow each other by establishing a follower and followee relationship between profiles. #PLANNED
    🏹 Enable users to like posts by linking their user_id to the liked_post in a junction table. #PLANNED
    🏹 Ensure that a user’s biography cannot be left blank. If a user logs in without one, prompt them to add this information.


    🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
    I have achieved all requirements for this project
    🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
    Most stretch goals
    🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
    I do not believe these tasks are difficult. I have laid down the foundations for most features including the Likes and Followers stretch goals from the beginning with my database structure, and I have planned psuedo code when I was feeling too rough to properly implement the features. Had I known how easy doing the not found page was I could have persavered and finished 3/4 stretch goals despite feeling unwell, assuming my plan on how to implement likes and follows is not severely flawed.
